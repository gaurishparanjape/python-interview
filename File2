Imagine a judge hears only one side of the issue, frames the whole picture on the basis of one party, the same party that will pay the judge his salary and then gives judgement that the party paying him is the just one. Absurd and delusional right?

Erm, now think about therapy.

Big cricket day tomorrow. The 4th test in Ranchi, the #WPL from Bengaluru and the Ranji Trophy knockouts. And of course there is the #IPL clearly visible in the distance now.

Been working on this for months! I'm joining Ridge as chief creative partner and joining the board.

Honestly they're the perfect partner to start making actual products. Big and experienced enough to have the manufacturing expertise to turn ideas into reality BUT not too big that they're unwilling to listen and be nimble. I have a lot of product ideas, and together we're going to actually make them happen

Also on this crazy journey as a creator I've been lucky enough to open doors along the way, and this feels like a great signal for future creators to be able to do the same.
